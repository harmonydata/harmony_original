# List of the training PDF files

The majority of the training PDF files used in the development of this tool are available publicly.
They downloadable by the `download-raw-pdfs.sh` script.
A small minority of files are not public and will not be downloadable.
However, you can still develop the tool using the public files.

Some files may also not be downloadable with wget but can be downloaded by the browser. If you get any errors, you can try searching the internet for a file of that name.
